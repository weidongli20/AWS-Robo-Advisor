# RoboAdvisor
## Robo Advisor for Retirement Plans

Combine the new Amazon Web Services skills with Python superpowers, to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan:

1. Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about the requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

2. Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. 

### Files

* A python script with your final lambda function.

* The ZIP files exported From the Amazon Lex Console (exported bot, intent, and slot using `Amazon Lex` as the target platform).

* A short video showing a demo of the Robo Advisor in action from the test window.
